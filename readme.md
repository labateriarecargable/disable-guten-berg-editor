Since WordPress 5.0 was released on December 6, 2018, we can find the default Gutenberg editor, with this tool there seems to be no middle ground, either you love it or you hate it. Some say that the detractors are not ready for this tool, while others believe that being an instrument in development presents problems, we don't have the absolute truth, but the truth is that it completely changes the user experience, and if what you are looking is like returning to the old and comfortable classic editor, this plugin is the solution.
